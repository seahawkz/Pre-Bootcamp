//1.  Biggie Size - Given an array, write a function that changes all positive numbers in the array to the string "big".  Example: makeItBig([-1,3,5,-5]) returns that same array, changed to [-1, "big", "big", -5].
//2.  Print Low, Return High - Create a function that takes in an array of numbers.  The function should print the lowest value in the array, and return the highest value in the array.
//3.  Print One, Return Another - Build a function that takes in an array of numbers.  The function should print the second-to-last value in the array, and return the first odd value in the array.
//4.  Double Vision - Given an array (similar to saying 'takes in an array'), create a function that returns a new array where each value in the original array has been doubled.  Calling double([1,2,3]) should return [2,4,6] without changing the original array.
//5.  Count Positives - Given an array of numbers, create a function to replace the last value with the number of positive values found in the array.  Example, countPositives([-1,1,1,1]) changes the original array to [-1,1,1,3] and returns it.
//6.  Evens and Odds - Create a function that accepts an array.  Every time that array has three odd values in a row, print "That's odd!".  Every time the array has three evens in a row, print "Even more so!".
//7.  Increment the Seconds - Given an array of numbers arr, add 1 to every other element, specifically those whose index is odd (arr[1], arr[3], arr[5], etc).  Afterward, console.log each array value and return arr.
//8.  Previous Lengths - You are passed an array (similar to saying 'takes in an array' or 'given an array') containing strings.  Working within that same array, replace each string with a number - the length of the string at the previous array index - and return the array.  For example, previousLengths(["hello", "dojo", "awesome"]) should return ["hello", 5, 4]. Hint: Can for loops only go forward?
//9.  Add Seven - Build a function that accepts an array. Return a new array with all the values of the original, but add 7 to each. Do not alter the original array.  Example, addSeven([1,2,3]) should return [8,9,10] in a new array.
//10.  Reverse Array - Given an array, write a function that reverses its values, in-place.  Example: reverse([3,1,6,4,2]) returns the same array, but now contains values reversed like so... [2,4,6,1,3].  Do this without creating an empty temporary array.  (Hint: you'll need to swap values).
//11.  Outlook: Negative - Given an array, create and return a new one containing all the values of the original array, but make them all negative (not simply multiplied by -1). Given [1,-3,5], return [-1,-3,-5].
//12.  Always Hungry - Create a function that accepts an array, and prints "yummy" each time one of the values is equal to "food".  If no array values are "food", then print "I'm hungry" once.
//13.  Swap Toward the Center - Given an array, swap the first and last values, third and third-to-last values, etc.  Example: swapTowardCenter([true,42,"Ada",2,"pizza"]) turns the array into ["pizza", 42, "Ada", 2, true].  swapTowardCenter([1,2,3,4,5,6]) turns the array into [6,2,4,3,5,1].  No need to return the array this time.
//14.  Scale the Array - Given an array arr and a number num, multiply all values in the array arr by the number num, and return the changed array arr.  For example, scaleArray([1,2,3], 3) should return [3,6,9].
